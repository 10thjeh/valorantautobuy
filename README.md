# Valorant Autobuy
Python script for automating valorant buy

The demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/tKZmf_kqllo)

# Dependency

[pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) and [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)

# Starting the script
1. open valorant
2. open main.py (python3 -m main.py, or other command you use for running py script)
3. press f1 to autobuy
4. press f12 to stop the script

actually step 1 and 2 can be flipped over, just do to your content of your heart

# Using the autobuy

Press F1 to trigger the autobuy, make sure the shop is closed so the script can work properly (this script is, no shit, not integrated to valorant so i cant detect if the shop is opened or not, or maybe you can but im too lazy to implement it)

# Status of the project
Currently it is still beta and hardcoded, still working on the configs so you can choose your autobuy settings
